# Task ID: 10
# Title: Setup eBPF Development Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure eBPF toolchain with aya framework and create basic XDP program structure
# Details:
Create udcn-ebpf crate with aya dependencies. Configure eBPF build system with proper LLVM requirements. Create basic XDP program skeleton with packet inspection. Set up udcn-common crate for shared structures between user and kernel space. Add eBPF program loading infrastructure. Include proper error handling for eBPF operations.

# Test Strategy:
Verify eBPF program compilation and loading. Test basic packet inspection without crashes. Validate shared structure synchronization between user and kernel space.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set up eBPF toolchain and build environment [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Configure the development environment with necessary eBPF tools, libraries, and compilation infrastructure
### Details:
Install and configure libbpf, clang/LLVM for eBPF compilation, bpftool for program management, and set up proper kernel headers. Create Makefile or build system for compiling eBPF programs with proper flags and target architecture.

## 2. Create XDP program skeleton with basic structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Implement the foundational XDP program structure with entry point, basic packet processing logic, and return codes
### Details:
Create XDP program with SEC() annotations, implement xdp_md context handling, set up basic packet parsing infrastructure, and define XDP action return codes (XDP_PASS, XDP_DROP, XDP_REDIRECT, etc.). Include proper license declaration and version info.

## 3. Define shared data structures between kernel and userspace [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create common header files and data structures that will be shared between eBPF programs and userspace applications
### Details:
Define packet metadata structures, statistics counters, configuration parameters, and any shared enums or constants. Create header files that can be included by both kernel-space eBPF code and userspace C programs. Include proper alignment and padding considerations for cross-boundary data sharing.
