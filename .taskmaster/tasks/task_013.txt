# Task ID: 13
# Title: Implement Content Store with LRU Caching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Build kernel-space content cache with LRU eviction policy and efficient lookup
# Details:
Create ContentStoreEntry structure with name hash, data pointer, size, and hit count. Implement LRU eviction algorithm in eBPF. Add content store lookup and insertion logic. Implement cache statistics collection. Create content store size management and memory limits. Include cache hit/miss tracking and reporting.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for LRU eviction policy and cache operations. Performance tests for cache lookup efficiency. Test cache behavior under memory pressure and various access patterns.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design cache structure and data layout [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the cache data structure, hash table layout, and memory organization for eBPF map-based caching
### Details:
Design the cache structure including hash table size, bucket organization, key-value storage format, and memory layout optimized for eBPF constraints. Define data structures for cache entries, metadata storage, and hash collision handling.

## 2. Implement LRU eviction algorithm [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1
### Description: Develop the Least Recently Used eviction mechanism for cache management
### Details:
Implement LRU algorithm using doubly-linked list or timestamp-based approach suitable for eBPF environment. Handle cache entry aging, eviction triggers, and maintain access order tracking within eBPF map constraints.

## 3. Implement lookup and insertion operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.1, 13.2
### Description: Create core cache operations for key lookup, value insertion, and cache updates
### Details:
Implement hash-based key lookup, value insertion with collision handling, cache hit/miss logic, and atomic operations for concurrent access. Ensure operations are optimized for eBPF instruction limits and memory constraints.

## 4. Add statistics tracking and monitoring [pending]
### Dependencies: 13.3
### Description: Implement cache performance metrics and monitoring capabilities
### Details:
Add cache hit/miss ratio tracking, eviction counters, memory usage statistics, and performance monitoring. Create mechanisms for exposing cache metrics to userspace for debugging and optimization purposes.
