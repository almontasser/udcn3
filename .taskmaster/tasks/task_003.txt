# Task ID: 3
# Title: Implement Name Structure and Matching
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Create NDN name handling system with component management and prefix matching
# Details:
Implement Name struct with component vector management. Add methods for name construction, component access, and prefix matching. Support for name comparison, longest prefix matching, and name hierarchy operations. Include name component encoding/decoding with proper type handling. Add name validation and normalization functions.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for name operations including prefix matching, component manipulation, and edge cases. Performance tests for name comparison operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement name component management system [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build core data structures and classes for managing name components including parsing, storage, and component extraction
### Details:
Create NameComponent class with methods for splitting full names into components (first, middle, last, suffix, prefix). Implement component storage with metadata tracking and component type identification. Include methods for component access, modification, and reconstruction of full names.

## 2. Develop prefix matching algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Implement efficient algorithms for matching name prefixes with support for fuzzy matching and similarity scoring
### Details:
Build prefix matching engine with Trie data structure for fast lookups. Implement fuzzy matching using edit distance algorithms (Levenshtein, Jaro-Winkler). Add similarity scoring system for ranking matches and configurable matching thresholds. Support partial matches and wildcard patterns.

## 3. Build hierarchy operations functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1
### Description: Create system for managing hierarchical name relationships and operations between parent/child name components
### Details:
Implement hierarchical tree structure for name relationships. Add operations for traversing hierarchy (parent, children, siblings, ancestors, descendants). Include methods for inserting, moving, and removing nodes while maintaining hierarchy integrity. Support bulk operations and hierarchy validation.

## 4. Create validation and normalization functions [pending]
### Dependencies: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3
### Description: Implement comprehensive validation rules and normalization algorithms for name components and hierarchies
### Details:
Build validation engine with configurable rules for name format, length, character sets, and structural constraints. Implement normalization functions for case handling, whitespace cleanup, diacritics removal, and character standardization. Add validation for hierarchy consistency and circular reference detection.
