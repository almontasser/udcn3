# Task ID: 11
# Title: Implement Basic XDP Packet Filtering
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create XDP program for Interest packet identification and basic filtering
# Details:
Implement XDP program for packet parsing and Interest identification. Add basic packet filtering based on NDN packet headers. Create statistics collection for processed packets. Implement packet pass-through for non-NDN traffic. Add proper bounds checking and verifier compliance. Include debugging support for eBPF development.

# Test Strategy:
Test XDP program with synthetic packet traffic. Verify packet filtering accuracy and performance. Test verifier compliance and program loading stability.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement packet parsing logic [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop eBPF program to parse network packets and extract NDN packet headers and fields
### Details:
Create packet parsing functions that can handle Ethernet, IP, and NDN packet formats. Must work within eBPF verifier constraints and kernel space limitations.

## 2. Build Interest identification mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Implement logic to identify and classify NDN Interest packets from parsed network traffic
### Details:
Use parsed packet data to identify NDN Interest packets based on packet structure and naming conventions. Must be efficient for kernel space execution.

## 3. Develop filtering rules engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2
### Description: Create configurable filtering system to allow/block NDN traffic based on defined criteria
### Details:
Implement filtering logic that can process identified Interest packets against user-defined rules. Must handle rule evaluation efficiently in eBPF context.

## 4. Implement statistics collection [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.3
### Description: Build system to collect and export NDN traffic statistics and filtering metrics
### Details:
Create data structures and mechanisms to track packet counts, filtering actions, and performance metrics. Must use eBPF maps for data sharing with userspace.
