# Task ID: 14
# Title: Implement User-space Daemon (udcnd)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 13
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create management daemon for eBPF program loading and control plane operations
# Details:
Create udcnd crate with eBPF program loading capabilities. Implement face management API for network interfaces. Add routing table management and FIB operations. Create control plane for eBPF map management. Implement configuration management and runtime parameters. Include health monitoring and statistics collection.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for daemon startup and eBPF program loading. Test face management operations and routing table updates. Verify control plane communication with eBPF programs.
