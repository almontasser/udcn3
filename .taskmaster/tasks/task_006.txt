# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Interest/Data Exchange over QUIC
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the core NDN protocol flow over QUIC streams with proper packet handling
# Details:
Implement Interest transmission over QUIC streams. Add Data packet response handling with proper stream management. Create packet framing for QUIC streams with length prefixes. Add timeout handling for Interest satisfaction. Implement basic flow control and stream multiplexing. Include error handling for network failures and protocol violations.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for Interest/Data exchange. Test timeout scenarios and error conditions. Verify stream multiplexing works correctly with multiple concurrent requests.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Interest Transmission Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create module to handle outgoing Interest packet transmission with proper encoding and network socket management
### Details:
Build Interest packet encoder, socket management for outgoing packets, and transmission queue handling

## 2. Implement Data Response Handling Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create module to process incoming Data packets, validate signatures, and handle content verification
### Details:
Build Data packet decoder, signature validation, content verification, and response processing pipeline

## 3. Implement Packet Framing System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create packet framing layer to handle NDN packet structure, encoding/decoding, and wire format compliance
### Details:
Build TLV encoder/decoder, packet boundary detection, fragmentation handling, and wire format validation

## 4. Implement Timeout Management System [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create timeout handling for pending Interest packets with configurable retry policies and cleanup mechanisms
### Details:
Build timeout tracking, retry logic, exponential backoff, pending Interest cleanup, and timeout event handling

## 5. Implement Stream Multiplexing Layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Create multiplexing system to handle multiple concurrent NDN streams over single network connection
### Details:
Build stream identification, concurrent request handling, flow control, and multiplexed packet routing
