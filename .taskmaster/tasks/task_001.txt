# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Project Repository Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the foundational Rust workspace structure with all required crates and configuration files
# Details:
Initialize Cargo workspace with udcn-core, udcn-transport, udcn-ebpf, udcn-common, udcnd, udcn-cli, and udcn-bench crates. Configure rust-toolchain.toml with pinned nightly version. Set up .gitignore for Rust projects. Create scripts directory with build.sh, test.sh, and docker-test.sh. Initialize docker directory for container definitions. Configure workspace dependencies in root Cargo.toml.

# Test Strategy:
Verify all crates compile with `cargo check --workspace`. Ensure scripts are executable and basic structure is correct.
