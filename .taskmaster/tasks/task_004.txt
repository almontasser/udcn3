# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Basic Signature System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add cryptographic signature generation and verification for Data packets
# Details:
Implement Signature struct with signature type, key locator, and signature value. Add SHA256 digest computation for Data packets. Implement basic RSA signature generation and verification using ring crate. Support for signature validation and key management. Include signature info encoding in TLV format.

# Test Strategy:
Unit tests for signature generation and verification. Test with various key sizes and signature types. Verify signature validation against tampered data.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement signature structure and data model [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement the core signature data structure with proper fields for certificate information, timestamps, and metadata
### Details:
Create the signature container structure that will hold all signature-related data including certificate chains, signing time, and signature attributes. Define interfaces and data models for signature validation and verification.

## 2. Implement cryptographic operations for SHA256 and RSA [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Integrate SHA256 hashing and RSA signature verification using established cryptographic libraries
### Details:
Implement secure hash computation using SHA256 algorithm and RSA signature creation/verification operations. Use well-established cryptographic libraries and ensure proper key management and validation.

## 3. Implement TLV encoding integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Create TLV (Tag-Length-Value) encoding and decoding functionality for signature data serialization
### Details:
Implement TLV encoding/decoding to serialize signature structures and cryptographic data. Ensure proper tag definitions, length calculations, and value encoding for interoperability with signature standards.
