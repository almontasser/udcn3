# Task ID: 15
# Title: Implement Basic Benchmarking Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create performance measurement tools and traffic generation capabilities
# Details:
Create udcn-bench crate with traffic generation capabilities. Implement synthetic Interest/Data traffic patterns. Add latency and throughput measurement tools. Create cache hit rate monitoring. Implement topology simulation for testing. Include performance regression detection and automated testing.

# Test Strategy:
Verify traffic generation accuracy and measurement precision. Test benchmarking tools with known performance characteristics. Validate topology simulation correctness.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement traffic generation module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create synthetic traffic generators for different network protocols and patterns
### Details:
Design and implement traffic generation capabilities including TCP/UDP flows, HTTP requests, and configurable bandwidth patterns. Include support for burst traffic, constant rate flows, and realistic application traffic profiles.

## 2. Develop measurement and monitoring tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1
### Description: Build comprehensive network performance measurement and monitoring infrastructure
### Details:
Create tools for measuring latency, throughput, packet loss, jitter, and other network metrics. Implement real-time monitoring dashboards and data collection systems for performance analysis.

## 3. Design network topology simulation framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 15.1, 15.2
### Description: Create flexible network topology simulation and emulation capabilities
### Details:
Build a framework for simulating various network topologies including hierarchical networks, mesh networks, and custom configurations. Include support for link characteristics, node properties, and dynamic topology changes.
