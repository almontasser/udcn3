# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Enhanced File Transfer Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add large file support, resume capability, and advanced progress tracking
# Details:
Add support for files larger than 1GB with efficient memory usage. Implement resume capability for interrupted transfers. Create detailed progress tracking with ETA calculation. Add parallel fetching optimization. Implement error recovery for failed chunks. Include file integrity verification and checksum validation.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests with large files (multi-GB). Test resume functionality after interruption. Verify memory usage remains constant for large files and parallel operations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement large file handling capability [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create mechanisms to efficiently handle large file uploads and downloads with chunking and streaming support
### Details:
Implement file chunking algorithms, streaming upload/download functionality, memory-efficient processing for files exceeding available RAM, and appropriate buffer management

## 2. Develop resume capability for interrupted transfers [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Build functionality to resume file transfers from the point of interruption
### Details:
Implement checkpoint system to track transfer progress, validate partial file states, handle reconnection logic, and resume from last successful chunk

## 3. Create comprehensive progress tracking system [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Implement real-time progress monitoring and reporting for file operations
### Details:
Design progress calculation algorithms, implement progress callbacks and event handlers, create progress visualization components, and ensure accurate percentage calculations for chunked transfers

## 4. Implement file integrity verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.2, 17.3
### Description: Add robust mechanisms to verify file integrity throughout the transfer process
### Details:
Implement checksum calculation (MD5, SHA-256), verify chunk integrity during transfer, validate complete file integrity after transfer completion, and handle corruption detection and recovery
