# Task ID: 16
# Title: Implement Transport Optimization Features
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Add fragmentation, reassembly, and pipeline fetching for improved performance
# Details:
Implement packet fragmentation and reassembly for large Data packets. Add pipeline fetching with configurable window size. Create multi-threaded operation support. Implement connection pooling for efficiency. Add congestion control awareness. Include adaptive pipeline sizing based on network conditions.

# Test Strategy:
Performance tests for fragmentation and pipeline fetching. Test multi-threaded operation under load. Verify connection pooling efficiency and resource management.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement packet fragmentation and reassembly [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement packet fragmentation for large data transfers and reassembly logic to reconstruct original packets
### Details:
Create fragmentation algorithm to split large packets into smaller chunks that fit network MTU. Implement reassembly buffer and logic to reconstruct original packets from fragments. Handle fragment ordering, duplicate detection, and timeout scenarios.

## 2. Implement pipeline fetching mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create pipelined request/response system to improve network throughput by sending multiple requests without waiting for responses
### Details:
Design pipeline queue system for managing multiple concurrent requests. Implement request ordering and response matching. Add flow control to prevent overwhelming the receiver. Handle pipeline stalls and error recovery.

## 3. Add multi-threading support for concurrent operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Implement thread pool and synchronization mechanisms to handle multiple network operations simultaneously
### Details:
Create thread pool manager with configurable worker threads. Implement thread-safe data structures and synchronization primitives. Add work queue distribution and load balancing. Handle thread lifecycle management and graceful shutdown.

## 4. Implement connection pooling system [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3
### Description: Design connection pool to reuse network connections efficiently and reduce connection overhead
### Details:
Create connection pool with configurable size limits and timeout settings. Implement connection health checking and automatic cleanup of stale connections. Add connection sharing strategies and load balancing across pool. Handle connection lifecycle and resource cleanup.
