This follows the established Service trait pattern with start/stop/restart lifecycle methods for consistency with existing EbpfManager, FaceManager, and RoutingManager components.\n\nThe control plane will bridge the gap between the completed face management layer and routing operations, providing the missing coordination layer needed for full NDN network participation and dynamic routing decisions.\n</info added on 2025-07-09T08:01:13.640Z>",
