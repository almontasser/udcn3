# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement File Transfer Receive Functionality
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8
# Priority: high
# Description: Build the file receiving capability with Interest expression and reassembly
# Details:
Implement Interest generation for file chunks with proper naming. Add Data packet reception and reassembly logic. Create file reconstruction from received chunks. Implement pipeline fetching for parallel chunk retrieval. Add progress tracking and error recovery for failed chunks. Include file integrity verification after reassembly.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for file receiving with various file sizes. Test pipeline fetching efficiency. Verify file integrity after transfer and handle missing chunks.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Interest Generation Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a separate module for generating and managing interests/requests for data chunks
### Details:
Design and implement interest packet generation, interest state tracking, and interest retransmission logic as a standalone component

## 2. Implement Data Reception Handler [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a dedicated data reception module to handle incoming data packets
### Details:
Implement data packet validation, buffering, and initial processing separate from other pipeline components

## 3. Implement File Reassembly Engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.2
### Description: Create a file reassembly module that reconstructs files from received data chunks
### Details:
Implement chunk ordering, duplicate detection, and file reconstruction logic that operates on buffered data from the reception handler

## 4. Implement Pipeline Fetching Coordinator [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Create a pipeline management module that coordinates the fetching process across all components
### Details:
Implement pipeline state management, component coordination, flow control, and error recovery mechanisms that orchestrate interest generation and data reception

## 5. Implement Integrity Verification System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3
### Description: Create a separate integrity verification module for validating data and file integrity
### Details:
Implement checksum validation, signature verification, and integrity reporting that operates on reassembled files and provides verification results
