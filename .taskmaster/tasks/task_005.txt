# Task ID: 5
# Title: Setup QUIC Transport Foundation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize QUIC transport layer using quinn crate with basic connection management
# Details:
Create udcn-transport crate with quinn dependency. Implement QuicTransport struct with connection establishment, client/server modes, and basic stream management. Configure TLS 1.3 with self-signed certificates for testing. Add connection pool management and error handling. Include transport configuration for NDN-specific requirements.

# Test Strategy:
Integration tests for QUIC connection establishment. Test client-server communication with basic data transfer. Verify TLS handshake and connection security.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement QUIC connection management [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up QUIC protocol connection establishment, maintenance, and teardown with proper error handling and connection state tracking
### Details:
Create QUIC connection manager with methods for establishing connections, handling connection events, managing connection lifecycle, and implementing proper cleanup procedures. Include connection state monitoring and reconnection logic.

## 2. Configure TLS security layer [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Implement TLS configuration for secure QUIC connections including certificate validation, cipher suites, and security policies
### Details:
Set up TLS context with appropriate security settings, certificate handling, and validation procedures. Configure supported cipher suites and implement security policy enforcement for QUIC connections.

## 3. Design connection pooling system [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create connection pool management for efficient reuse of QUIC connections with load balancing and resource optimization
### Details:
Implement connection pool with configurable pool size, connection reuse strategies, load balancing algorithms, and connection health monitoring. Include pool cleanup and resource management features.

## 4. Integrate NDN-specific transport configuration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Adapt QUIC transport for NDN protocol requirements including packet format handling and NDN-specific optimizations
### Details:
Configure QUIC transport layer to handle NDN packet formats, implement NDN-specific optimizations, and ensure compatibility with NDN forwarding semantics. Include performance tuning for NDN workloads.
